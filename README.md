Welcome to the open-source repository for the personal portfolio of **Dev Loka**. This site serves as a central hub for my research, projects, and insights spanning **Web3 smart contract auditing**, **DevSecOps engineering**, and **AI-driven vulnerability research**.

## 🎯 Core Focus Areas
* **Autonomous AI Bug Bounty Platforms:** Developing systems like [OMEGA BLACK](https://github.com/dev-loka/omega-black) for continuous, automated threat detection.
* **Web3 & Smart Contract Security:** Implementing zero trust architecture and formal verification for decentralized applications using Solidity and Ethers.js.
* **Secure Full-Stack Architecture:** Hardening React/Vite frontends and Node.js backends against modern exploit vectors.
* **DevSecOps Pipelines:** Automating SAST/DAST and dependency scanning within CI/CD workflows.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture
This portfolio is built for maximum performance, accessibility, and search engine visibility.
* **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Variables, Flexbox/Grid), ES6 JavaScript.
* **Animations:** Intersection Observer API for lightweight, scroll-triggered fade-ins.
* **SEO Optimization:** Semantic HTML, fully implemented Schema.org JSON-LD structured data, dynamic Open Graph/Twitter meta tags, and targeted keyword density.
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages with a custom `.nojekyll` bypass for optimal asset routing.
